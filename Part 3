Calculations for part 3:



	3. The value is 4.5323361762439625
		- calculations are in my Encoder class between lines 129 - 136

	4. The value is 4.636420867375511
		- calculations are in my Encoder class between lines 139 - 142

	6. The value is 4.573562402829805
		- calculations are in my Encoder class between lines 145 - 148
	
	7. My encoder achieves better compression because the calculated entropy value
	   is closer to the theoretical entropy value. The closer to the theoretical
	   value, the better!
